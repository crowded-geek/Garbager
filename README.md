for a better world -_-

It's a solution to tackle this human nature of spreading garbage on the streets by providing them with rewards in the form of some benefitial discounts or coupons or small monetry amount on making a contribution to clean the society. A man can contribute by uploading a picture of him disposing in a dustbin with a QR-code on it , letting us know about his contribution.
